## UNIVERSE FOUNDATION

### Magic : 

defining magic, mana as per usual, mana is magic, its energy, its base of everything.
mana is the most generic shape of magic, it can exist in many shapes and forms, and be specific to an element,
be it natural stuff 
like fire water and such,
or more abstract concept 
like life, death, time, light 
and such, albeit more rare.

### Universe formation :

pop, mana was created in the space, started aggregating and specializing in diff types of stuff, creating all kinds of astros.
fire and light mana made stars, earth, water and air did planets and moons and such

but the most imp was those planets who devoped life mana, so that life would start, first mixed with primal elements, created elementals and spirits and as other types of mana and as magic developed and specialized, so did life, be it natural causes, or some external blessings, curses or anomalies.

ofc some world were more advanced and in diff evolution eras than each other and world 1 was one of the most advanced

### world 1 past :

in the beginning, world 1 had a big spike in life mana/energy which led to a big bloom in life, creating advanced lifeform without the help of other types of mana, and so it was highly dominant, difficulting the evolution of other types of life on the planet, (many greens)
then during a cosmic time know as the shard fall, a lot of mana meteorites, colossal mana shards floating adrift in the universe, were being pulled towards the plantes by their gravity and altering the balance between element/types of mana in each planet
world 1 had a lot of these, destroying the dominance of life and creating an era of elemental chaos, enhanced by the high levels of life mana in the planet, the shards rapidly developed intelligent elementals and derivatives that would fight against each other for territory trying to established some balance that would be constantly destroyed by the next shard to fall
eons later, the last shard falls, ??? changes things around ??? balance is restored all around, and life starts evolving steadily

random fire mana shard

### world 1 present :

bunch of time later balance was established and a lot of diversity prospers, civilizations were built and such...
it maybe has 3 enormous continents with large island regions around, big elemental landmarks from the old eras (old mana shards) and thats pretty much the big picture.

### RANDOM NAMES

Telarin (zone)
Galladyrn (zone)

###RANDOM IDEAS

- a mage city and a universital city that fight over whos the best magical city

- life mana shard on the surface with a giant tree enveloping it, maybe the redts of one of the first mana shards on the underground (earth), shattered by the collisionod the other one.

- a fire mana shard in a volcano area, an ice/water/wind one in a snowy mountain place, another earth shard for the dwarves, diff mana shards under the ocean created water species diversity ??

- diferent religions that have big distinct beliefs, one that praises mana shards as the will of god or something, that has a more obsessed branch searching for remains of mana shard cores for the power they hold,, in more faraway places have ppl venerate these cores or ppl who hold their power

- what is the power of mana shards ? how can it be harnessed ? how strong is it compared to the intrinsic power of living beings ? maybe the mana shards had a core ?? the outside has aroudn the same power per size and can vary a lot in size, the core holds incredible amounts of condensed mana and have a more fixed small pocket to backpack size

- nice story "twists": have humans being the outcast race in some places for whatever, 
the gods in here aint gods, just powerful ppl.
extremely specific evolutions of certains kinds of magic, like demon magic? 

- create a bunch of biomes, civilizations and medium sized ideias (countries  empires, big independent cities, important forest and other landmarks), and start mixing them together

- make all of these power balanced, ex: dont put the most magic advanced civilization close to an enemy magic less country

- create history not just story, which empires first began, what led to it and how borders and landscape change.

- small piecws of mana shards and mana shard cores can be refined to create rune shards

## evolution of some species:
### humanoids :
- earth bipeds -> got away from earth manashards -> fleshy -> humanoids (no manashards became humans, life manashard became elves ?, reconnect with earth shard -> dwarves, some else ??) (also other aspects would affect species themselves/not manashard exclusive alteration)

### semi animals:
- normal animals with high permanent exposure to a life shard

### water creatures:
- water elementals + life shard contact -> normal water biodiversity -> other mana shard combinations ? 

### other mana shard origins and combinations ??

the idea of a world soul, in planets with high mana levels and big life mana, all of its mana starts reacting and interacting with eachother in at a global scale, creating reactions and balance between each kindnof magic, these more organic feeling reactions and changes are attributed to a world soul which doesnt necessarily exist (like weather gods, natural catastrophes can feel tied to emotions or organic thinking decisions)
make religion out of world soul
